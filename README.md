1. As we open the HTML code of Hacker news, we see three tags: html, head and body.  
The `html` tag is for telling the browser that has to run an HTML code. Represents the root of an HTML document and container of all other HTML elements.  
As for the `head` tag, it contains all the head elements, like title (required on an HTML code), scripts, styles, meta information, and so on.
Inside the `body` tag, the body of the document is contained, and also all other body elements like text, hyperlinks, images, tables, etc.  
  
    Now, inside the `head` tag, we have `title`, `meta` and `link` tags: 
       
    The `title` tag is just the title of the document (which is not displayed on the screen, so it may be different than the page header).  
    The `meta` tag provides metadata (information of the data) of the HTML document. The `meta` elements are used to specify page description, keywords, author of the document, last modified, and other metadata. 
    The `link` tag defines a link between a document and an external resource, is also used to link to external style sheets.  
    
    On the `body` tag, are two elements: `center` and `script` tags. The `center` tag is for align the text on the centre. And the`script` tag defines a link between a document and an external resource, is also used to link to external style sheets.  
    Inside the `center` tag, we have the `table` tag that defines an HTML table, and contained on this tag we have four `tr` tags, that defines the rows of the table. Inside of each one, we have `td` tags that determines the cells of the table. In some of `tr` tags we have `tbody` tags, that defines the body of the table. Also we have a `br` tag that inserts a line break, an `img` tag that inserts an image, an `a` tag, that inserts a hyperlink, a `span` tag that groups elements on a line and a `form` tag that creates a form for user input (on the `input` tag that is also found).
